      "sentence": "40 Hours in and I am enjoying the game a ton  Quick run down before I get into the details below The Traversal is amazing the characters are each unique The Environment looks gorgeous performance has been good fun end game and its just super fun to play the gameplay loop of traversal and shooting  My biggest issue with the game is lack of variety in mission design and enemy types I would love more groups of different enemies roaming the cities on in missions \n\n I do not like much Super Hero or Comic book related things  Other than loving the old Arkham games City being my favorite enjoying the Super Hero strategyrpg from the Xcom devs and liking the Batman movie from the 80s and The Dark Knight  That is it every other thing Superhero related I have not enjoyed over the years \n\nI hated the Gotham Knights game that came out last year hated Marvel Avengers was not big on the Guardians of The Galaxyetc  but I am having a real blast on Suicide Squad \n\nLastly I also am not a big fan of Live Service games usually I enjoyed most my time with the Division games have enjoyed Helldivers II and I play some Diablo 4 but in general have not had a good experience with Live Service games \n\nPositives:\n  Some of the best traversal and movement ever i am going to reminds me of Sunset Overdrive and Crackdown 12 with its Traversal but even better \n  Movement is super smooth ties into the traversal but yeah controlling these characters is a blast\n  4 very unique characters that handle totally different  especially for Traversal and moving around the map while fighting or to get to missions  Its just fun as hell learning each character and leveling all 4 up \n  If you like Arpgs give this a try gives me alot of the enjoyment I get with good Arpgs  This is half Arpg and half Live Service \n  They are actually doing the Season Passes very user friendly you can comeback at anytime and do a later season if you missed it and they are also releasing a bunch of free content  This is the way you do a Season pass i am going to \n  Graphics are amazing well done to all the character and environment devs they killed it the game world is gorgeous and very well done \n  The Audio is very well done from the sounds of things to the voice work top notch work here\n  Gameplay is just overall good fun from moment to moment wiith traversal being so good then right into a fight as you are traversing all over its great fun \n  I love controlling and leveling up all 4 characters takes awhile to learn them all if you are in a clan you can also end up having some of your friends characters It seems to take the highest level for each AI character you have with you \n  The story is pretty decent I usually always end up skipping the dialogue and cutscenes in Superhero games except for the Arkham games  Despite loving the Xcom guys Marvel game I was skipping all the dialogue at the Abbey base as it was terrible  This game though while not amazing story has not made me skip it yet so its good enough for me :\n  Controls are very good you always feel in control and feels great once you master a few characters you did not use much earlier on in the game \n  No crashes and no big fps issues for me in 20 hours on the game  Only bug I had was once at the end of a mission it sent me from multiplayercoop to my singleplayer and I had to do the side quest again was not a big deal  This game is much better shape than Arkham Knight was on PC on release \n\nNegatives: \n  There needs to be a little more variety in the quest structures and for the side quests that are around the game world and end game \n  I wish there was a handful of different groups of enemies walking around the city  There are groups that go around  the stuff in the sky helis and drones but they all look the same add 2 or 3 more groups that have variety please\n  In 40 hours on the game I been disconnected from the games servers 4 times so far and had the off small bug not alot  but hope this gets straightened out  Not nearly as bad as say Diablo 3 on launch though but still a few kinks that need to be worked out Had zero bugs during campaign but in end game have had a few\n  No Fully Offline mode Although the devs say its coming\n  I enjoy the shooting but the melee is not as fun as it was in past Batman games\n  Like all Live service games there is not enough content once you finish the game looking forward to Season 1 content but its such a wait \n\n\nOverall this game is a nice surprise as I said previously I am not big on Super Hero games or Live service games but this is good fun  Is it perfect No of course not  Is it the best game ever no  But its a really fun Super hero game that I was not sure how I would like but 40 hours in and I have had a blast  Yes it is different than the old Arkham games but its still super fun i am going to just in some different ways   I hope people give this game a shot because its fun as hell \n\nI have played a bunch of the End Game now and its good fun much better than Marvel Avengers or say Outriders end game  I would score it a 7 510 personally will not win any GOTY awards for me but really it just needs more variety in enemies walking the streets and in mission design and more end game content \n\nDespite my issues with the game I would still rather play this than I would Marvel Avengers Destiny 2 or Gotham Knights traversal and combat is just way more fun for me in this game than those other Super Hero or live service games  No it is not a new Batman Arkham game but it is still a very fun time to be had \n\nWill Not be my GOTY of 2024 and probably will not be in my Top 10 but overall I still had fun while playing this game and in the end that is what matters most to me in games  Not as good as the Batman games but still lots of fun to be had here",

      "sentence": "Well Ill try to be as thorough as possible to give everyone a real good idea about how to go about this game and see if its for you \n\n\n\nStory:\n\nThe story is a good bit more light hearted and plays quite different to Arkham so if you are trying to extract an Arkham trilogy story experience from this game it is sadly not for you  There is a pretty good eb and flow to the story which is nice  Yes there are dry moments but also some amazing sequences that left me in a pretty wow state  Overall the character work and such were amazing with the members playing off each other  I think the main story felt a bit short right now  But given that the expectation is the story will keep expanding into each season well see how this evolves  But unfortunate coming from Rocksteady who have been prided on their amazing story work in Arkham Gameplay:As a person that loves fast chaotic gameplay this was my cup of tea  Once you nail down the movement for the characters they become quite fluid and have pretty unique playstyles that takes a bit to master but fun to start getting used to this  I started with Harley as its the most Arkham like character but expanding in to Boomerang and King Shark was quite different and loved the experience so far  \n\nThe chaos you either love or you hate  If you like borderlands or crackdown I think you will like it  But if you are die hard Arkham probably not the experience you were hoping for  The modifiers add a pretty good change to normally just shooting enemys  As you move more into the later game realize that movement and constantly being on the move is very important or else game over at the later stages  Get used to movement because it will be your only option once you get into the harder difficulties and endgame \n\n\n\nEndgame:\n\nAs I Am just entering Endgame I Have been enjoying it  The build crafting has a bunch of death with Notorious and Infamy sets with Villan synergys to add an extra layer  I think it has quite a ton of depth to really build that dream character  And now for the difficult part  The missions  Like with most live service the endgame loop gets a bit dry toward as you climb  Same style missions and then going into Elseworld and doing more or less the same  My hope as that the mission set expands as the season goes and brings challenges that really test the capabilites of my builds  I Have always loved raids and I think it could work here given the character set world and mechanics  I have yet to reach the final horde mode so well have to see what that provides as well \n\nFeatures:\n\nI think they did a great job in terms of features  Social squad is great to pull characters that are pretty built up if you do not want to touch certain ones  Leaderboards clans and other social features are widely present which is awesome to see  Crafting enchancing and other mechanics are built naturally into the story and really bring power to your builds which is awesome to see which some of the bigger looter shooters are still working on  And plenty of loot to go around  I think I have more difficulty figuring out what to get rid of especially since you do not have a gear score so everything is pretty viable even in endgame \n\n\n\nOverall:\n\nI think its a good game but pending because we have to see how seasons stack up overtime like any live service  I think they did a pretty good for the initial release  I have not had very many issues in terms of bugsglitches  Very slight got my character stuck in a turret and game crashed once if anything  But very smooth  Pointing back to what I stated before if you go into this game thinking you are getting an Arkham game yes I know its in that universe it is 100 NOT that type of game  But if you take it with an open mind and enjoy the game for what it is it becomes quite enjoyable  But this really depends on what type of games you like  So I recommend it to the person who loves looter shootersgrindy games with a solid story  Because that is where the meat and potatoes is supposed to be But off the initial release there is not much mission diversity which hence hurts the games standing",

      "sentence": "Note that this game and the genre of game is not for everyone \n\nSo overall the public discourse on this game can be pretty decent and downright rough when it comes to a few topics that that i will label here \n\n1  Corporate Shills : people blindly defending a game refusing to see any form of criticism whilst paying for this games microtranscations upcoming battlepass repetitive missions weird loot \n\n2  Valid Critics: people who generally have decent valid criticism about a game and its mechanics and developer choices without being either delusional or being akin to a rodent in human form \n\n3  Delusional People and Fanbases: yes i get your favourite hero got wiped off the playing field especially with the prior quadrilogy which are pretty good games but i guess if you want something to complain about you will find a million reasons  some of the delusional takes iv seen at attacking the devs that made the game instead of i do not know not playing the game \n\n\nActual Review:\n\nso overall i find the story of the game to just kind of be alright in general nothing amazing but nothing absolutely horrible either  just some things that could have used a bit more polish \n\nGameplay:\nEach character having their own style of play and traversal movement is honestly a really good touch similar to Gotham knights from what i have heard    i have never played it \n\nBoomerang has a speedforce gauntlet that allows him to zip around the world and in a fight at remarkable speed making it really good for that somewhat vague Doom like Playstyle \n\nHarley Quin has Batmans Drone and Grappler which allows her to swing around the open world kind of like spiderman but with very limited use cases pretty fun to swing from one roof to another during a fight \n\nDeadshot has a Jetpack which allows him to fly for a limited time in both fights and the open world with an afterburner ability that allows you to go pretty fast but burns the energy gauge faster \n\nKing Shark just does funny jumps kind of like crackdown or that really old hulk game pretty fun i just did not use him as much \n\nMissions in this game are very very repetitive but can be eased with the fun gun and movement mechanics aswel as doing combos and abilities  in later character levels you unlock more abilities tied to creating Combos so whilst you are cutting through enemies in a mission interesting abilities might activate in the middle of the fight  with the character gameplay the game had a good opportunity to make missions more engaging with more variety but it falls short   missions being repetitive goes for both main missions and side missions\n\nThis game reminds me vaguely of Crackdown and Sunset Overdrive \n\nCutscenes are pretty enjoyable in this game but some jokes are not as funny atleast to me since comedy is pretty subjective but even so i cannot say i was not engaged in any of the cutscenes going on \n\n\nLooter Shooter:\n\nLoot wise the game seems pretty odd to me but that may be myfault since i did not spend that much time using the overhaul or elite ing system in the endgame   i still have no idea what making an equipment piece Elite even does  \n\n\nOverall despite my lack of experience on min maxing or looking thoroughly into the best loot for a built this game does seem to have very good potential for build crafting in general \n\nPersonal Gripes: \n\nThis game  alright its not amazing nor is it horrible is generally not worth the 60 to 70 price tag id reccomend getting this game on a sale for it to be worth the possible fun you might have with the game \n\ni will say this game did feel somewhat short ish me and my friends played during the 72 early access and completed the game and got into the endgame before the game came out \n\ni get most games now generally have battle passes but most of the are free 2 play games so its a bit more forgivable and understandable but this is a fully priced game that has an upcoming battlepass which is somewhat sickening to me aswel as there being micro transactions at launch  even in the 72 hour early access  i guess if its just not your thing just do not buy the game or buy the game and ignore them \n\nSUMMARY:\n\nThis game is fun but has the average Looter Shooter issues with boring objectives and repetitive missions  good gunplay interesting abilities cool character and diverse movement interesting cutscenes with some comedy kind of like Sunset Overdrive Cringe Upcoming Battlepass Microtransactions in a full priced game Overpriced game buy on sale",

      "sentence": "English: \nWe have to start by THIS IS NOT A GAME IN THE STYLE OF THE ARKHAM SAGA although it is developed by the same studio and is in the same universe though in terms of story it only has nods to the Batman saga this is a 100 different bet  We are no longer the bat we are no longer in Gotham \n\nThat being said this is a good game it feels solid and well planned made with love  Its not a game for everyone as the Shooter Looter genre is very present in a well grounded way  However it changes a lot from the usual superhero games  My rating for the game is 8 06 and I will be explaining point by point without spoilers what I thought:\n\nGAMEPLAY and PERFORMANCE: Its a game that was running well since early access very smooth no frame drops and with very solid graphics  It features 4 playable characters this is before the release of any extra content that are very different from each other  Personally I loved the games mobility being very effective and feeling comfortable with 3 out of the 4 characters  The gunplay is very solid combining melee and ranged attacks in a well executed manner with a good variety of mechanics that does not become overwhelming like in other games  Very well thought out and executed  In my case I followed the suggestion to play with a controller and the mapping felt very well done  910\n\nCHARACTERS: The four main characters are well crafted each having their own essence both narratively and in terms of gameplay  I was afraid it would feel like the same character with a different skin but fortunately it does not  Each one has its own identity and is very enjoyable  In terms of gameplay you will likely stick with one or two characters for the comfort of their mobility and combat style as their different styles naturally make some more comfortable than others  1010\n\nSTORY: The story is good not spectacular or entering any historical top but it works  I expected a bit more from this studio which has shown it can have very good scripts  The story has its funny moments brought by our four criminals and there are some pretty good moments with the league but it does not go beyond that  7 510\n\nENEMIES: The variety of enemy models is limited similar to the Arkham saga but its functional  You do not need more since they have variations covering a wide spectrum of things you might need  There are helicopters tanks common units shooters armored units a strange bug that revives enemies and a very strong large unit  Several of these units have variations which helps so that you do not have to learn many mechanics  They are few intuitive and functional  810\n\nBOSSES: I do not want to go into much detail here to avoid spoilers but they feel powerful and make good use of each ones iconic powers  There Is one fight that I did not like much because it was very average but the others I enjoyed quite a bit so I think they did quite well considering the characters are VERY difficult to bring into gameplay as they are practically gods  8 510\n\nSIDE MISSIONS: This is where the game fails more strongly in the base content excluding the endgame  Six characters give you side missions to farm resources and unlock the possibility of having better things to create and modify your weapons  However it fails because it lacks extra story quickly falling into repetitiveness  They only add obstacles on how to kill enemies to add a variant to the game and its practically doing the same thing with each one  The good thing is that there are few side missions  5 510\n\nSHOOTER LOOTER: The mechanic in my opinion is well grounded giving you pretty good weapons very early in the game  There Is also the option to have 4 traders who can improve and change weaponsstatistics avoiding the need to farm like crazy until you get a specific weapon with the desired upgrades and statistics  This makes the game much more enjoyable to play  910\n\nEXTRA CONTENT: As part of the studios signature there are many unlockables that can be obtained from skins audio designs art sketches etc  very much in the Rocksteady style  If you liked that in Arkham you will like it here  If you did not like it in Arkham you will not like it here  Personally I liked it but in my opinion this does not warrant a rating \n\nGAME AS A SERVICE AND MICROTRANSACTIONS:\n\nI see it as a positive that all playable content released after the launch is free avoiding having to buy a certain amount of DLCs  Regarding the Season pass I also see it positively that you can get any Season pass even after the season has ended avoiding FOMO and allowing everyone to see and buy the Season passes they like at their own pace  At the time of this review the first Season pass has not been released but once it is I will update this review with my opinion on the content  The skins released at launch did not attract me and there are three versions of each skin: Base epic and legendary or similar names  The base is the basic skin without much more the epic is the skin with variations of look and color and the legendary is what comes in the epic but with even more things  Obviously the cost increases depending on the version but it did not seem too expensive to me  Here I think it depends a lot on each persons economy so its subjective  For now its a 710  If more things come out and my opinion changes I will update the rating \n\nSUMMARY: Its a good game and personally the post launch content attracts me a lot and promises a lot  Unfortunately many people have thrown a lot of hate at this game without having played it just because of what they have seen or because it says game as a service  I believe Rocksteady has made good decisions on how to handle the game as a service and they have announced that they will incorporate more HUD adjustment options so that you can have your HUD as you want introducing an offline mode and more things to come in the following seasons  Currently I do not think the deluxe version is worth it since the most attractive part was early access  I would suggest buying the standard version at full price or on discount depending on each person  Enjoy your games enjoy your tastes and if you do not like something say it but let us not blindly throw hate that only makes this great gaming industry stink more  Cheers \n\nSpanish: \n\nHay que empezar por ESTO NO ES UN JUEGO

      "sentence": "h1 A Nice Surprise Good But Not Quite There Yet SPOILER FREE h1 \n\n  \n\nWith 25 hours on Playstation and forgetting I Pre Ordered it on Steam too I have played a solid amount of this game and have completed the Story too  While I am doing a lot of side quests in preparation for the endgame I think I have made enough progress to put in my review  \n\n  \n\nI remember first playing this game at the start of December after receiving an invite from WB to test the game out  On first impression I was not sold  I could not bring myself to play more than an hour and so I sent in my answers to the survey and forgot  \n\n  \n\nThen in the middle of January I get more advertisements on social media about this game  So I start looking into it more and it gets me looking forward to it again  So that leads to today  \n\n  \n\nh3 The Characters h3 \n\n  \n\nNo Joker \n\n  \n\nAll four of the characters are well made and the group has good banter between the squad  The casual conversations the reminiscing conversations about their rivalry against their unique villains and their sentimental stories about their past really make them feel human   \n\n  \n\nI played a large majority of the game 17 hours as King Shark as his mobility and abilities felt the most fluid out of the squad and his humour and characteristics were my favourite  Then Boomerang Deadshot and finally Harley Quinn   \n\nEach member had unique abilities that screamed their character and different ways of mobility too although Harleys needs some work done  But what this means is that there is a character that will suit anyone playing and looking through a lot of peoples play styles its pretty diverse   \n\n  \n\nThe jokes can happen a bit too often and can be made at the wrong time where it takes your attention away from the emotion the writers are trying to make you feel b BUT b there was numerous times where I did chuckle and it did help a scene too   \n\n  \n\nOverall while I do think the comedy moments sometimes feel forced or overly used I do like each character and their characteristics  Their play styles are just far apart enough to make them play different and while I did play one character more than the rest I do believe I will try my hand at all of them in time  810 \n\n  \n\nh3 The gameplay h3 \n\n  \n\nProbably the most important part to me I love story and writing in games b BUT b gameplay is just as important to me  As I previously mentioned about each character and their unique gameplay that part is really solid and gives you a chance to enjoy each character or play as just one  \n\n  \n\nThe gunplay is also really nice while some weapons feel similar there are a lot that have unique perks or shooting styles Think exotics in Destiny but I found myself using the same weapons throughout my playtime not because I did not like the others I just found the weapon types that suited me best  Overall pretty solid  \n\n  \n\nBut the worst part about the gameplay are the objectives as you play through you find yourself playing a lot of the same objectives with a new coat of paint depending on where you are or who you have got the mission from  While there are a good amount of objectives within the game and with the boss fights being all unique I did find myself rolling my eyes when a certain objective showed up  \n\n  \n\nOverall the gameplay largely carries the game itself with the characters and gunplay feeling solid  Its just a shame that the objectives felt too repetitive and would sometimes take your immersion out the game  710 \n\n  \n\nh3 The Story h3 \n\n  \n\nWithout spoiling it I will just make this section short and try explain it enough  \n\n  \n\nThe story has us follow the b Suicide Squad b and they now have to b kill The Justice League b \n\n  \n\nWe follow as the earth is being invaded and metropolis is the main city under siege by Brainiac  We make our way throughout each section of the city as the story goes on visiting staple locations and meeting the characters to go with it   \n\n  \n\nThe first 6 hours feels a little rushed to introduced the massive amount of characters but does a good enough job to keep them relevant throughout as they all play their part Some better than others  Then with the rest of the story making you feel like you are progressing through with each character  The story took me around 15 hours since I was not doing it completely linear   \n\n  \n\nAround 70ish of the City is used for the Story but after each mission you are required to travel a few minutes to the next location and then the next location  So what I would do to ease that tedious time is to pick up collectables along the way  Best to do that so you do not get bored  \n\n  \n\nAs for the Boss fights I think each person will have their personal take on which fight was the best I do believe that a majority are pretty strong but there is one in particular which I was disappointed with I think you know  \n\n  \n\nOverall the story will be hit or miss but for the most part I did enjoy it and had a blast throughout  Each character carried their part but as for the objectives not the boss fights felt pretty repetitive but the dialogue and cutscenes carried the story side of the game  710 \n\n  \n\nh3 Verdict h3 \n\n  \n\nWhile I see a lot of mixed feelings about the game I did find myself really enjoying my time throughout my 20 hours  While I have only completed the story and have dipped my toes in side quests I find myself looking forward to the endgame and what there is to come later on   \n\n  \n\nThe main characters were really solid and had good writing and comedy behind them the gunplay and gameplay had me hooked and the story was something I thought was a great time and good fun but nothing too great  Its just unfortunate that the repetitive objectives have really brought this game down for me and probably for a lot of other players and i am yet to go into the endgame so I have no idea if it will play any different  \n\n  \n\nOverall the game is a blast and if you do not take it too seriously its a really good time  710",

      "sentence": "After posting I realised how long this was  Feel free to skip to the end to see a brief list of thoughts or continue reading to get the full course meal\n\nI love this game a lot  The traversal for each character is unique and playing multiplayer with a varied squad feels amazing having everyone reach the objective in their respective ways  \nGunplay feels great too  I Am god awful at aiming and I thought the flashy movey ness of the game would make shooting hell but the autoaim and the melee into pewpew combo makes it a non issue  I commonly play shooters on mouse and keyboard but this feels FAR better to play with a gamepad so please do \n\nThe story is I would call it charming if it was not an IP bigger than the biggest thing I Have seen which is perhaps a building of sorts  But yes the story is nice I like the writing I Am fucked up and I think each of the character dynamics are really funny when worked together  \nHOWEVER once the base game story ends you enter into the episodic content which are a series of seasons released post launch as a live service aspect  THIS is the worst part of the game by far but that does not quite mean its bad  Sorta \n\nThere are four seasons with two episodes each  They have their own levelling systems that first progress with doing whatever mission you want killing time ftw and later after the final mission of each episode progress with the mastery levels accounting for the top three masteries you have achieved in an episode  The game explains it better  Anyway the first episode of each season unlocks a character once you beat it and from what I remember the first episodes are usually the longest 25 levels required to get to the last mission instead of 10 in the second episodes but you can also unlock the characters with premium currency which Ill talk about more in a little bit \nThese have small amounts of story and even less of the charming dialogue I enjoyed in the base game but its more gameplay which as I said I enjoyed  However I usually did the bare minimum to progress into the next episode instead of trying to max out each one 200 levels \n\nYou can do this too There Is no expectation of you to go beyond the level required to face the boss of each episode  The only real reason to stay and grind episodes is to get weapons from infamy sets which will help you a lot with harder content  Infamy sets are collections of weapons which have unique set bonuses three per episode usually and villain synergies with notorious items a step above legendary and utilising them fully will grant you immense power There are also corrupted slightly different bonus but strong notorious items and master just better quality gear \n\nLots of loot for a looter shooter which is great  What is not great is that while the infamy sets are interesting they are not really strong  The Bane infamy set the one available from the end of the base game wins out in most cases for being easiest to utilise strongest outright and just generally easier to grind you can go after specific tiers once you reach the right mastery level while the episodes give you all three tiers in every mastery level meaning you are dealing with a lootpool that is three times as big  This is why I say you can totally just cruise through the episodes  the gear in them is not going to be an amazing increase to your power minus a couple of notorious items so there is no point in grinding them unless you REALLY want to make a build based on your favourite villain  In which case go forth \nBut even if you DO get a good build you are not going to be able to use it  Every episode ends on at hardest Sweating Bullets  You can replay all the missions at increasingly higher mastery levels but as soon as you go onto the next episode you are back to Sweating Bullets  There is an Invasion Level which affects the difficulty of the overworld but the only time spent there is when you are traversing to the next mission \n\nI got a bit lost in the sauce there I do love my rambling  Anyway premium currency The game has a store and battle pases all of the juicy stuff you come to expect from modern games  I never used the store I played boomerang outside of levelling other characters and his best outfit is the default but each of the battle passes at the very least give you enough currency 1000 to buy another battle pass  I got the deluxe edition super cheap and that gives you access to one battle pass so once you max one out you can go onto the next and the next and the next completely free  Ah and all four battle passes are in the game and can be swapped between at whim  This is good for a battle pass \nAgain you can also buy the characters with premium currency  I do not know why you would unless you seriously want to play Deathstroke as early as possible I think the earliest you can be a non default TFX member is post game But I could be wrong I did not buy any of the characters but the option is there \nThe store is just cosmetic shit  It sucks but its there if you really want to buy cosmetics for a game that failed at launch  Whatever \n\nI talked about it a little bit earlier but the story for the episodes is a little bit lacking  Most have animated cutscenes before you fight the boss and just after and every episode has a slideshow like introduction  The bossfights are fairly repetitive but they are all better than the base game final boss which is battle of attrition whenever I try it  They were clearly running out of money towards the final major update  \nThe last two episodes have a single animated cutscene between them and its not even the ending  There Is barely any dialogue and they feel the most barebones of all which just plain sucks  When getting to the bosses the fights just start  The new character is introduced in a codex audio log  Its like they barely even tried  I liked the ending I enjoy bad things but my god did the quality of the last two episodes sour it \n\nAlso all of the additional characters have Deadshots hover when aiming in the air ability and I just hate that \n\nRant over  To summarise: \nBase game rocks episodes are repetitive but can be fun though drop off towards the end \nStory is fun characters are fun but both have so little place in the last few episodes that you might miss them \nLoot stops being meaningful extremely quickly literally immediately if you play Finite Crisis the base game endgame state \nDifficulty is generally incredibly low and raising it is exclusive to each episode \nPremium store and battle passes :\nPlay on controller unless you hate me personally \n\nDead worth it on sale currently its 9 for deluxe 6 for base  Force some friends to buy it and have a good time  Or hate it  But give it a chance  I understand this being the only real Justice League game sours it for a lot of people but go in with an open mind and enjoy  Maybe pray for a fully fledged JL game in the future  Thank you for reading if you got this far I love you",

      "sentence": "Great story mode that is been overshadowed by its notorious live service and activist consulting elements \n\n\nI usually only buy games at a good discount and when I can buy the whole game so I do not get to play too many games until usually between six months and three years after initial release   If I get to play it soon its either a huge hit with a sequel or expansion coming out putting it on sale or a huge bomb that I Am getting for a discount thanks to companies trying to get more players or recover some costs before it ages out of pop culture   This game is an example of the latter \n\nI heard bad things about it from the fact that it hired activist consultants to the fact that it was yet another live service game that required an always on internet connection and did not really do anything new or different for its genre   Over the holidays it went on a steep discount to 5 for the deluxe edition and I ended up buying it twice because it went on sale on Epic Games and then Steam my preferred vendor days later \n\nI had just upgraded my computer and wanted to play a graphic intensive game and so the stars aligned when I realized that I just got a recent game and could play it for its story mode they were coming out with an offline mode and wrapping up the Seasons in January   So I fired it up and I had initial mixed feelings until Chapter 4 \n\nInitially I did not care too much for the character models or controls except for Deadshots so I played him throughout   They were fine but I liked the movies characters more and so needed to get used to these more genericized versions though Superman looks a LOT like Henry Cavill   The fun and goofy elements were nice but it was just okay at first   And the activist consulting shows up early on with a large sociopolitical banner every time you leave the main building and a bunch of self referential jokes about race swapped characters and such   I ignored that as best as I could because I just wanted to have fun and fortunately everything but the banner went away by the ending \n\nThe gameplay was basic shooter stuff with a lot of vertical play and the setting in the tutorial was pretty bland but then you do enter Metropolis with the aliens and once you actually explore on the ground its a great environment flying from one place to another is uneventful pretty quickly   But I really enjoyed the Riddler elements: the trophies show up on your map when they enter your field of vision and the riddles you had to scan were fantastic except for one ridiculous one about a hidden door with Xs over it that is almost impossible to see I was staring right at the same wall multiple times and could neither see it nor get it to count when I scanned said wall several timesit was the only one I had to look up because I did scan that location but it would not work unless you were right up against it \n\nMy feelings about the game though changed in Chapter 4   This chapter made the whole game as it had a good engaging story interesting battles that were well structured earlier ones are pretty basic and late game battles in Brainiacs dimension are just filled with visual noise and amazing visuals I must have taken dozens of screenshots   Everything clicked and it made the game worth playing just for that part alone \n\nThe fighting felt like a third person Borderlands the colorful visual overlays of enemies and such and the various guns with bonuses and displayed brands and was okay great and then just repetitive and overdone at the end   The final fight was disappointing because it was a rehash of The Flash boss plus huge fights where there is just so many bullets and enemies that its hard to even track what is going on \n\n\nThe Positives\n A AAA title means high quality graphics big time set pieces and plenty of cut scenes and story beats \n\n The talking in the game is astoundingfor the first 10 20 hours of gameplay it seems like there is something new that your team Lois Lane or supporting characters have to say   I only heard a few repeats until the very end where I heard the same audio probably 5 10 times while I leveled up or completed contracts without playing a story or side mission \n\n The idea of playing the baddies and getting to kill the justice league while being anti heroes is a nice one and that was the best part of the game \n\n Many of the visuals were fantastic and the Riddler riddles and trophy finding were some of the best Id ever played compared to how it was done in the Batman series   I was able to solve them all myself even though I had to look up once to figure out what I was doing wrong scanning the hidden door one \n\n The game forces you to use all of your abilities so that you can get used to them and incorporate them into your unrestricted gameplay mechanics which I enjoyed \n\n\nThe Negatives\n It feels like this game was made for someone with ADHD   There is so much stuff being thrown at you visually and early on audially   And the end battles are just bullet fests not in a good way   Chapter 4 had the best balance of all the games elements \n\n The activist consulting output is in your face but you can just ignore it fortunately \n\n The battles are repetitive after a while and by the end its just noise when you have three Brutes jumping on you every 10 seconds while you are getting shot at by four helicopters and have 3 sniper laser sights pointing at you all at the same time I am not exaggeratingI literally had this all happen to me at once in the other dimension \n\n I understand how the live service elements micro transactions and activist elements could have turned people off and its part of why I think there is too much stuff going on but I just ignored them and so I cannot speak to whether the multiplayer was any good or not   I played it like I played the Batman games \n\n If there were any rewards for completing all of the Riddlers collectibles I did not see itthat was hugely disappointing since everything else you did in the game rewarded you with equipment or a cool cut scene or something   If it were less fun than it was I would have been mad but they made it fun to complete and so it was weird but I quickly moved on and forgot about it \n\n Its a tad buggy   Id have my game performance slow down occasionally in the Hall of Justice area and for a day or two my game would just freeze for a full 5 seconds and then continue as if nothing happened not my computerit was running fine the rest of the time   Also I was confused when after you hit level 30 your level resets to 1 in the lobby and so I thought I lost my game save for a moment   Weird game design choice \n\n\nOverall I do recommend this game despite all of the negativity surrounding it   I thought that the story mode was a lot of fun and the gameplay decent enough to play to see the whole story which was amazing in the middle part even though it was a little slow at first and bizarre and anticlimactic at the end   If you treat it like another game in the Batman series I think you will like it especially if you get it for just a few dollars   If you are not so keen on the live service elements the battle passes and microtransactions though 9 99 is not micro put into a game that was originally priced at 70 the slightly repetitive gameplay or the small activist inserts then you can pass on it   But do not let the negative social media deter you if you think you will like the story modeits worth it for the middle section",

hand and take your freedom away  It treats you like a bumbletruck idiot \r\n\r\nThen there is the story\r\n\r\nAnd what they do to the Justice League is shameful \r\nThe Flash is slow Batman is dumb Superman is weak The Green Lantern has no imagination and Wonder Woman is a fool \r\nThey all die like dogs in the most pathetic anticlimactic ways imaginable \r\nSo much disrespect \r\nThey blow

I Am not sure what they were thinking  Killing these beloved characters was always going to go over poorly   but doing so in such a disrespectful mean spirited and moronic way is injury to insult to injury \r\n\r\nThe ending is a joke   a bad joke   it goes back on everything the game did because of how horrible it was all received but flops pathetically \r\n\r\nThe entire experience   getting

      "sentence": "I love the Arkham games and this game is here solely to spit on their graves \n\nThe game is decidedly not built to play alone  Even in single player you have lives and need to wait for the bots to revive you  Multiple times I Have had them just dick about jumping over me and missing the ledge where I Am downed so I Am just waiting for a long time to be able to play  I do not want an end of mission screen that tells me who did the best in the squad  Its me  I Am playing solo  I KNOW I DID BETTER THAN THE ZERO OTHER PLAYERS  There Is also a LOT of sniper enemies in the game and in solo it amounts to most combat encounters having 5 6 sniper lasers pointed at you and only you the entire time  They also stand far enough back on ledges that if you are not above them you cannot hit them and then when you get to where you can hit them they teleport to a different ledge \n\nDo Not forget every character also has a unique way of getting around the city  Also do not forget every one of them is made INCREDIBLY limited and input intensive so that you cannot move too much faster when other players are around  As everyone is playing solo however this just serves to make the movement around the city INCREDIBLY cumbersome  Even moreso when you realise there is only one fast travel point on the entire map and its in one of the far corners not even the middle \n\nThe 4 characters lack identity  Why do I want to play any one over the others They all play exactly the same way  They share the same guns between them only each character is limited to 3 gun types out of 5 they share grenades their special moves are just 1 aoe damage and 1 single target damage move  There Is nothing that sets them apart  In terms of personality they are all VERY one note  If I have to hear about Deadnot having a daughter one more time I Am going to hunt her down and feed her to Braniac myself  Every character has a perks system every perk is just at combo do more damage  No perk has felt meaningful or worth changing your playstyle to use more efficiently  Its worht mentioning that there are unlockable cosmetics for playing however I now have all of them and only one outfit for one character does not look like absolute shit because obviously they want you to go to their store to buy the half decent ones \n\nThe actual gameplay is ok for a while but it gets stale fast  Its one of those games where there is about 4 enemy types and then later they will pretend there is new ones by reskinning the starter enemies and maybe giving them a little gimmick  There are short infinite missions for crappy rewards but they highlight how shallow the gameplay is because every single one is just kill 10 of one enemy type kill with gun type use status effects  Later in the game you receive a SECOND constant batch of the exact same missions  Why Do Not Know they feel just as worthless \n\nThe actual missions also feel samey just kill shit sometimes with a gimmick about only this attack does damage sometimes with a basically meaningless collection aspect  No mission so far has felt significantly different from any other  The actual bossfights against the League are super underwhelming almost all of them just being keep shooting while they repeat the same 3 attacks followed by the League member just doing the most default falling over animation ever when their hp bar finally runs out and that is the kill \n\nEarly game most of the combat is spent re climbing scyscrapers because that is where all the enemies are and if a helicopter gets involved they WILL freeze you which throws you all the way down to ground level before you are allowed to break out of the ice  Tanks are allowed to perfectly track and shoot at you through multiple buildings \n\nThe loot system sucks  I Have basically just glazed over and only read the DPS and unique passive because there is so many meaningless stats  Also its 2024 where the hell is the button to scrap everything in my inventory below a certain quality I Am getting popups of stuff was sent to the mailbox because your inventory is full because I have to go through and manually mark 300 crap tier pieces of junk for scrapping  And its not just go to your inventory and scrap  You have to go to each individual character and go into each slot to delete the items in that category  You cannot scrap Harleys melee weapons while looking at Boomerang etc  Its a slog \n\nSpeaking of slogs there is a daily reward which can reach high tier equipment and to get it all you have to do is spend over 2 hours every day hunting about 100 of one type of flying drone that spawns scattered over the map hundreds of meters in the air  They are not interesting or rewarding to kill on their own their only combat is to start a teleport to flee  Have fun Also good luck grinding them if you are trying to level King Shark because all the weapon types he can use are TERRIBLE at killing them \n\nThere are status effects which are genuinely terrible  I Have played for 30 hours and EVERY weapon I get with good DPS has this stupid Black Mask effect which sets fire to nearly every enemy  This stupid burning effect disables your ability to gain shields from enemies which means you very quickly run out they do not regen in combat without pickups and more importantly makes certain missions downright impossible when the enemies ONLY take damage from the shield harvest move  At this point I Have been relegated to using lower damage weapons just to not have the basic survivability tool fully disabled \n\nAdditionally there are some modes where only crits deal damage which is fine but all other damage causes enemies to heal instead  Several of these missions involve tanks which only take crits on their weak points  In solo this means you can destroy all of their weak points bar the one on their back because you cannot hit it when they target you instead of the bot teammates 100 of the time but the bots will just fire indiscriminantly keeping their hp at 100  You literally cannot kill the tanks around your teammates healing them \n\nRiddler exists again  Except this time because your characters lack gadgets or interesting gameplay mechanics his trophies just sit on the ground for you to pick up  His races are all less than 30 seconds long and the only ones I had to repeat were due to the next ring being hard to spot not hard to reach  After doing all of his stuff nothing  No Ill beat you next time no confrontation he just stops calling to nag you to do his stuff \n\nAnd look all of that is without even touching on the fact that to go between the main base and the open world you need to walk through a hallway of propaganda every time or that they race swapped a character who is established in the universe  Oh yeah that other Floyd Lawton the one who shot people from across an entire city bouncing bullets off helicopters and who went toe to toe with batman twice Yeah uh he was an imposter Yeah that is it \n\nAlso I forgot how many decades are we into gaming What the fuck is the excuse for forcing players to stand around locked into walking speed unable to leave a rooftop EVERY TIME people want to rant long boring instructions at me  TALK WHILE I MOVE I DO NOT WANT TO STAND STILL AND LISTEN TO EVERY LINE OF GO HERE SHOOT THIS DIALOGUE \n\nOne more edit and I Am not one for spoilers but this is something that prospective buyers NEED to know before they commit:\n\nspoilerThe end of the current games story is congratulations story complete continue the main objective in season 1  You cannot buy this game as is and finish the main storyline  A tremendous amount is set to be locked behind seasons which looking at the sales and player stats will not happen  If you are on the fence but still want to play the story wait and see what happens and whether they end up finishing the story when they shut down the live service spoiler",

      "sentence": "This game sucks in almost every aspect and its a miracle I was even able to finish the game fully if I was not playing with my friend I would have refunded the game before I went over the 2 hour mark  The story is awful and the justice league is not even going to be important going forward so why was not it called suicide squad kill brainiac and even if they bring them back like the leaks and rumors say then what the hell was the point in killing them  Another thing is that this game should NOT have been part of the arkham universe since for one there are barely any references to those games and it makes absolutely no sense for batman to come back after the ending of knight  In fact the only arkham game that I Have played is city and I went into this game completely blind without seeing any trailers or any gameplay from the other arhkam games and I understood everything so the only reason I could think of for this to take place in the arkham universe is so that more people would buy it  The suicide squad themselves are thoroughly unenjoyable as well  Dead shot is just some guy and does not do anything worth noting captain boomerang can be funny sometimes but obnoxious most of the time harley sucks since they made her almost exactly like her new iteration with her new personality which I hate with every fiber of my being and then there is king shark which is the best character from a personality and a gameplay standpoint but even then his personality dwindles towards the end of the game  One thing I will give the game credit for is the core gameplay itself as traveling from place to place is pretty fun though I only played as king shark and I definitely was not playing as harley since her movement sucks  The boss fights while being terrible from a narrative standpoint I found pretty fun from a gameplay standpoint surprisingly except for batman and brainiacs fights since brainiacs is just a carbon copy of flashs and batmans is just really bad since he does not move his attacks are so slow and easy to dodge and the whole buildup to the fight took so long and was so boring and made absolutely no sense how harley even made the gas mixture to counteract batmans it just made me not care for it  The leagues deaths are also pathetic as well since flash superman and brainiac all just flop on the ground with randomly physics and in flashs case he gets pissed on directly after green lanterns clothes fade away leaving him in his underwear making me not able to take his death seriously along with the terrible king shark ring scene which makes absolutely no damn sense and do not even get me started on batmans death I could go on all day about how disrespectful it is to arkham batman and his game legacy and how after harley shoots him with a revolver and yet a bullet she will can be heard falling on the ground nice one but its just so bad I Am not even going to bother ranting about it  Wonder womans death is the only one that they spent effort on and even then it does not make any sense why the squad is sad about her dying despite wonder woman disregarding them through the whole game  They should have been sad about flash dying too since he saved their lives like wonder woman did so what the hell  The game makes the league look completely braindead as superman and lantern want to greet the alien arriving to earth unprompted in a giant metal skull with open arms  This then leads me to the plot armor since there is absolutely no reason why none of the league members just completely kill the squad immediately at any point especially flash and superman since flash could easily tear out their hearts like he did to lex and superman could easily use his heat vision on them from a distance but instead decides to hit them up close with cars yeah that makes sense  This game should not be 70 dollars by the way it should have been 50 at most especially since most of the game is not even out yet and there is nothing so outstanding in this game to warrant the 70 dollars  Along with that there is overpriced in game currency that you can use to buy overpriced in game costumes with no way of earing the costumes or currency in game for free  Some other things to point out are how the skill tree feels completely pointless and does not do anything all that noteworthy to your characters there is too many repetitive missions in the game especially the escort missions where you wait for a car to move slow as hell on a straight path Amanda waller being as unlikable as the squad which may or may not have been intentional the riddler trophies and missions adding absolutely nothing to the game and to my knowledge it is not even explained why the riddlers here or giving you these challenges and the next few dlc characters looking to be as bad as the squad now with a joker who is too riddled with insecurities to know if he even is the joker Victoria freeze instead of Mr freeze for some reason Zoe Lawton which I can guarantee nobody asked forand I really do not care for dead shots and green lanterns beef with each other in the game it equates to nothing and his daughter is not even important at least not right now so there really was no point to it and deathstroke which might be cool but knowing current rocksteady and how they handled most of the other characters I would not be surprised if they screwed him up too  In conclusion suicide squad kill the justice league is an overpriced looter shooter that was made to disrespect the universe its set in and the characters it has set up and introduced one literally being the main character of the game series prior to this with unnecessary microtransactions pointless rewards missions skill tree and side quests with an abysmal story with abysmal writing that either ruins any pre established character development or ruins the characters later in the game that has no right being canon to the arkham universe since its so bad it actively ruins the legacy of the previous games and ironically this game would have been better had it not been set in the arkham universe  You Are paying 70 dollars for a game that is not even done and has a completely misleading title in the long run and has a terrible main cast of characters on top of that  Do not buy this game and if you really want to at least wait for it to go on sale first like I said this game is not worth 70 dollars in the slightest and you will feel disappointed and unsatisfied by the end especially with the abrupt ending  Its a 410 at best and should have just been a justice league game from the start  This game is pointless",

      "sentence": "One of the worst fucking games I have ever playedno exaggeration  This game is a joke but not even in a funny way as is evident in every single aspect of it \n\nEvery attempt at humour is painfully unfunny  The most laughs I got were from the absolute game breaking bugs and lack of proper infrastructure  The cutscenes are complete nothing burgers where pretty much every character says nothing but the most cringe inducing shit constantly  No ones motives make sense and every character is perpetually brain dead in the name of StOrY pRoGrEsSiOn  Worst of all the incessant voice lines in every fucking situation are unbearable  There are only so many times I can listen to Rick Flag or some other lobotomised cunt comment that I did something every three fucking seconds as I traverse around the map \n\nThis game is plagued with nothing but bugs  Boomerang disappeared and was nothing but a floating gun and boomerang for more than three chaptersaccidentally funnier than any joke made by anyone other than King Shark who was only humorous because of his unbelievable capacity to be nothing but brain dead \n\nThe only reason I have so many hours in this game is because I genuinely fell asleep playing it  It was that boring  It is a combination of the same four mission types  There are tutorials that are still unlocking as you finish the fucking game  \n\nOff rip you immediately deal tens of thousands of damage not even mentioning that you can immediately unlock the later seasons weapons from the inbox \n\nThe difficulty is a joke  My friends and I had to play at the hardest difficulty and only struggled in a single part because our games completely white screened after beating the final boss inadvertently failing the mission \n\nThe traversal is disgustingly mundane and infuriating  Considering these criminals now have the equipment of some of the most powerful DC heroes you would think that any one of them could move more than 100 metres without having a short 30 minute lunch break and a small siesta before even considering moving again  What makes this even worse is the fact that every mission is conveniently placed on the complete opposite fucking side of the map at every point throughout the story meaning that you get no choice but to go back over random buildings that you went past because ReaSoNS  This happens to such a stupefying extent that there is literally a mission where you do nothing but backtrack over multiple buildings you already traversed to get to the fucking mission start \n\nI do not think I Have ever experienced more anticlimactic fights in my entire 20 year gaming history  All fights finish instantaneously the fights are repetitive and predictable with Batman being the most disappointing which on the hardest difficulty available was killed by shooting him in the face  The best fight was Supermans purely because there was actual substance in the fight and it was not just go here do thing and continue  Though the fight ended the samehe just drops to the ground and that is itwhen anyone with any knowledge of DC knows that Superman should have laid these cunts out in a single instant without hesitation especially under the control of Brainiac \n\nTLDR\nSuicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is an unfunny slogfest of tedious cutscenes repetitive missions game crashing bugs and the worst possible boss fights known to man  I paid 5 for this game and even that feels like an incredible stretch for how much it should be worth",

      "sentence": "Better than iAnthemi worse than iDestiny 2: Beyond Lighti  410\n\nWith a completely straight face I can declare that this is a passable single player open world  But how on Earth 1 was WB going to turn it into a live service iDestiny 2i has major annual expansions with quarterly seasons iGenshin Impacti has continuous events and content releases and iDying Light 2i simply butchered its own DLC schedule to make a sequel  By contrast since launch KTJL has only added equipment battle passes quests and payment required characters  All around it is shockingly bad value doubly so with the seasonal material being removed upon updates  Its a DC themed iFar Cryi clone and it being dead on arrival has been the vindication gamers have pleaded for we want better games than this and will not buy this garbage  \n\nI think that KTJL is violently overhated  The narrative is nothing to write home about but has its high points  It feels more in service to the comic book fan rather than the prior Arkham games  Its humour is subjective and the tone is  lumpy at best but it is hardly offensively bad  Shooting is competent abilities are flashy and traversal is interesting  Audio quality is satisfactory and no loading screens in the open world is a nice treat  \n\nHowever a game composed nearly completely of rooftop arenas has an enormous and obvious design problem impossibility in creating variety  In almost all cases including boss fights combat takes place in a flat space broken up by vertical pillars which also have flat tops  Ground floor conflict is nearly entirely discouraged there are simply no objectives set on the lowest levels  Unintuitively since enemies do not take fall damage knocking an enemy off a roof causes a horrid inconvenience of finishing the rest of the fight hoping they make it back to you in time and then tapping the scanner to see where they are and scrounging out the kill  This whole spiel wastes a lot of time in a game where lightning fast movement is required for survival  However in the world of shooter design verticality is disparaged for the simple reason that display technology has favoured landscape images over portrait  Its not fun being shot or blown up from angles that a player cannot see without snapping their viewing angle straight up  KTJL is filled with these unpleasant occasions where players need to snap aim to targets they cannot see because in order to fire their gun they need to aim down sights narrowing the field of view and lowering sensitivity  Combined with the vertical nature of the environment design and the falling enemies taking aim will get you hit and enemies waste your time  However Aimlabs is free and I could be experiencing a skill issue  \n\nBrainiacs generic fodder enemies pack in some of the worst traits I Have seen in combat design  Every enemy is capable of deploying the one way shield seen on every roof even doing so when the squad is standing right next to them  A common enemy type that is simply immune to ranged damage until meleed  A universal two button counter that works on every enemy type as long as they show the counter UI  Sniper enemies that possess all of these traits and disappear to recover when attacked  Compared to other shooters irritation is the main feeling I have toward the experience as a whole  If none of that sounded fun it definitely was not to play  \n\nEscort kill all collect and deposit kill with special restrictions reach point and secure area objectives is very 2010s  If this were only for open world activities I would not be happy  Every main quest being constructed from these is downright depressing  You Would think that an open world RPG would create iFar Cryi outposts or towers for the sake of combat variety and this just does not have any  If iDestiny 2: The Red Wari a campaign composed of public events patrols and playlist difficulty strikes has more objective variety alarm sirens should sound at the design level \n\nAbhorrent continuous stuttering frequent fade ins laggy menus and janky performance do not tell half the story  bIts a deal breaker for performance alone b User interface is just broadly offensive the game possesses combat effects that visually stack upon one another with no option to shrink or remove less important ones  Its frequent that a team of fully levelled characters because sensory overload from reaching combos or throwing grenades  An eyesore overall  \n\nbDo not buy the Ultimate Edition DLCb at 53 AUD MSRP it is without a doubt the worst value proposition yet from a supposed ultimate edition of a game  But why What is the ultimate edition of a game supposed to do for you In iDestiny 2i which sells an annual pass at 75 AUD it contains all of the annual seasonal content for the game materials and activity accessdungeon keys all in one  That Is in the ballpark of buying iElden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtreei60 or iPayday 3: Year 1 Passi45 all of which possess around 30ish hours of gameplay and exclusive content  For this price point it needs to cover a year of playtime even if its not all at once  For iSSKTJL Ultimate Editioni you get ONE battle pass some guns freely acquired from the post game and skins  No characters and no store currency  In many ways its not worth even the 2 65 it was discounted to  My entire playthrough of the story only got me 20 ranks into an 80 level battle pass all 80 of which are required to unlock either another pass or one character  I Am not going through that much suffering for the opportunity to grind out another character I was done with this game long before that point  \n\nWhat disappoints gamers the most is missed potential and SSKTJL is simply reeking of it  With more care this could have been a DC themed peer to peer iBorderlandsi competitor with permanent expansion packs gear progression and campaign co op endgame  What we have instead is a cobbled together combat sandbox iDestinyi public events and a raid I guess  Neither the worst game I Have played this year nor the worst iFar Cryi clone I did not have an overall positive experience in this game",

      "sentence": "Dissapointingly hallow \r\n\r\nAs a DC fanboy I Have been hyped for this game since it was announced  I went into KTJL wanting to love it  But I came out feeling empty \r\n\r\nTo start the way people felt about this game was solidified from day one no one was happy with it  Despite the negative reception however I held out hope  Back when the game had not even released and many elements of the story were leaked and people criticized the hell out of it I was still optimistic about KTJL  \r\nThe circumstances sorrounding the build up to release were unfortunate  First it was like I mentioned the story leaking early  Meaning everyone knew that the justice league were actually going to die and for some reason despite the title of this game were surprised and did not like where rocksteady was taking the story  Then it was the death of Kevin Conroy which people used to bad mouth the game knowing this was his send off as Batman a mean spirited argument if I Have ever seen one  And last the many articles that came out criticizing the game all being done in bad faith talking bad about every detail that leaked like the hud being too crowded for example was a big one  Like I stated preciously despite all of this I was still hopeful that rocksteady would deliver a banger  And I was mistaken  \r\n\r\nIll talk about the combat first since I have a lot of things to say about the story  Ill preface this section by saying I played through the main campaign as Captain Boomerang since I heard he had the best movement though I imagine the rest of the characters vary little in combat diversity  The combat is actually fun  For being a looter shooter  It reminds me a bit of Doom Eternal if DE had 14 of its arsenal removed  The movement is smooth and thrilling  You also have a variety of special moves in your arsenal  The big complain aside from the something else Ill mention earlier is the gun variety  Seeing as there are only two guns you have at your disposal at any time it makes the gameplay get a repetitive fast  Its funny because the Arkham games which arguably have less variety in terms of what you can really do in combat never got old throughout the four main games  And this leads into what I mentioned earlier the gameplay gets old quick  This is in part because every mission despite how it may be worded is the exact same thing shooting bad guys until you can do something or something happens  Also this game is laughably easy  Let Us go back to the Arkham games comparison  In those games  you were not always doing the same thing in each mission you were also sneaking around doing detective work and many other Batman y things that complimented the combat  Nothing in this game compliments the combat at all shooting is everything  To end this section Ill talk about the bosses  Aside from story things Ill talk about later the bosses are bad  I was playing on the hardest difficulty available to me and I never died once aside from Supermans fight but that is because I was ignoring very obvious gameplay hints  The bosses just repeat the same few and I do mean few moves until you kill them  I do not have more to say about them because there is nothing to say  \r\n\r\nNow onto the very controversial story  Ill quickly touch on the less important aspects of it and move onto the big issues  First I really like the world building especially in the context of this being the Arkham verse  Metropolis is great  I reiterate again I was fine with the whole Killing the Justice League thing as long as it was done right and it was not shocker  I Am not referring to the whole Boomer pissing on Flash or Lantern being in his underwear controversy as that is the kind of thing I expected from a Suicide Squad game  The problem is that the deaths of these characters are not treated with the gravitas they should be  There is no send off for any member of the League aside from maybe Batman but I hesitate to call that a send off and the second they die its not even brushed off its just not touched on in the slightest like I get these are supposed to be bad guys but even then Id expect them to at least have SOMETHING to say  I could not even tell when I killed the bosses they just die again there is no grandeur for anything  Then there is Brainiac  The fact that the final confrontation on the main campaign is fighting him as the flash literally just reused the flash fight as the final boss says a lot seeing as he is barely a character  I do not have anything to say about him other than he was very disappointing  Sad seeing as hes the MAIN BAD GUY  Finally the end was horrible  At the end of the story they reveal that in order to kill Brainiac we have to fight and kill 13 different versions of him throughout the multiverse and once you kill the Brainiac in your Earth Amanda stabs him in the head with something the squad celebrate and then they are interrupted by Lex telling them they still have 12 more Brainiacs to kill and  cut to credits no I Am not joking the game ends and nothing significant happens because we have 12 other DLCs to promote  The only thing I can say I liked about the story was the banter between the squad it got a few chuckles from me \r\n\r\nOverall from the combat to the story to the characters this game is empty  There is nothing substantial here that makes it worth playing  Its really sad seeing not only how bad this game turned out but also how rocksteadys reputation was damaged  Not to mention the hole DC keep digging themselves in by releasing flop after flop  Ill wait to see how they wrap up this game if they even do it at all but I Have learned from my mistakes so my hopes are not high in the slightest  As much as it pains me to say this game is not worth playing if you really want to play it Id wait for a heavy discount because 70 for this is daylight robbery \r\n\r\nFinal notes for DC not like they will read it: Please stop using the evil Superman trope not only is it worn out its also the most boring thing you can do with this amazing character  Also stop making Superman villains Justice League villains I Am looking at you Brainiac and Darkseid",
